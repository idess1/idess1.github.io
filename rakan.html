            Gerrymandering is an <em>unfair political strategy</em> used to manipulate district
            boundaries to guarantee a winning party within a state. See a quick
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGLRJ12uqmk" target="_blank">example</a>.

          <p>
            Project Rakan seeks to challenge gerrymandering by analyzing the likelihood of a map
            being gerrymandered and providing visualization to real-time redistrictings, details in

            <h3>What I Did</h3>
            <div class="hr"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>I managed the team of six developers in an Agile/Scrum setting</strong> along
            with my co-founder. Specifically, I reviewed the team's agenda, goals, and challenges
            during the weekly sprint meetings. I assisted in <strong>designing and maintaining a
            RESTful API contract</strong> between the front-end and the back-end.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I also led the back-end team</strong> in developing C++ code, maintaining
            CI/CD and code reviews on GitHub, and assuring product quality via unit tests using
            the Google Test framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            In developing C++ code, I <strong>efficiently and correctly managed 13 data
            structures to optimized the look-up, insertion, and deletion time </strong> of
            frequently accessed data. I also <strong>implemented various algorithms</strong> such as
            BFS and Metropolis-Hastings.
          </p>
          <div class="break">
            <div class="hr"></div>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <div class="hr"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            First and foremost, I learned to adapt to and appreciate <strong>test-driven
            development</strong>. In my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3VpG_O1En3m-ba6O-dLO1V_paa2MMd-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
            reflection</a>, I mentioned the back-end bug that caused the beta-release of Rakan to be
            a failure. I took responsibility for the oversight and strived to fix the bug, which I
            was able to do so via extensive testing. This made me believe in test-driven development
            and test-driven debugging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I learn to <strong>communicate and collaborate with a large team</strong>
            efficiently. As the co-founder, I assisted in helping the front-end and back-end
            communicate both in-person and on code through a RESTful API. I also learned to
            <strong>collaborate through pair programming</strong> which the back-end team to
            both ensure my teammate is up to pace and help me think through my code.
