            <div class="hr"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this project similar to real-life implementations of distributed systems such as
            Amazon's DynamoDB or Google's Spanner, I aim to build a distributed database that
            withstands server failures and network complications such as delayed or dropped
            messages.
          </p>
          <div class="break">
            <div class="hr"></div>
            <h3>What I Did</h3>
            <div class="hr"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I <strong>built a fault-tolerant distributed database</strong> using various methods
            such as Primary + Backup and Distributed Concensus. I also <strong>balanced workload
            among servers via sharding</strong>, increasing performance and preventing server
            crashes due to high-traffic. In addition, I <strong>implemented dynamic load
            balancing</strong> when servers join and leave, or when shards are moved.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Distributed Concensus method, I <strong>implemented the multi-instance Paxos
            algorithm</strong> in which all servers replicate each command in the exact order as
            prompted by the leader. This way, I <strong>guarantee high-availability and
            linearizability</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I <strong>took out countless obscure bugs</strong> due to various network
            complications via backtracing, rubber duck debugging, and good ol' print statements.
          </p>
          <div class="break">
            <div class="hr"></div>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <div class="hr"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            This project <strong>enhanced my passion for problem-solving</strong> given that it is
            not only difficult, but also extremely obscure to debug. Owning up to the challenge and
            being able to explain the bugs gave me a great sense of accomplishment and thrill!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also worked on my <strong>pair-programming skills</strong> in this project. In
            working with a project partner, I was able to work on articulating my train of thought
            and reinforcing my own understanding of the concepts.
